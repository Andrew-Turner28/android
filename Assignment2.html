    <h2> Experience </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Robotics Team Lead </li>
      <p>For a semester at Arizona State I was the leader of a four-person team that was tasked with building and programming a robot that could: autonomously navigate a maze, respond to specific colors within the maze, and be able to use a lifting mechanism to retrieve and transport a cardboard cutout of an individual in a wheelchair. I was involved hands-on with the designing, building, and programming of the robot. Additionally, I was responsible for coordinating the other members of the team to complete all necessary tasks and meet our deadline.
